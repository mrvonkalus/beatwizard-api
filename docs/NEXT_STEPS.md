# 🎯 BeatWizard Next Steps

**Last Updated:** August 20, 2024  
**Priority:** Immediate deployment and visual polish

## 🔥 **Immediate Actions (Today)**

### **1. Monitor Backend Deployment (Priority 1)**
```bash
# Check every 30 minutes until resolved
curl -s https://beatwizard-api.onrender.com/api/status | python3 -m json.tool

# Expected change:
"current_phase": "phase_1" → "phase_1_m4a_enhanced"
```

**When Backend is Ready:**
- ✅ Test M4A file upload
- ✅ Test enhanced NLU conversation endpoints
- ✅ Verify error handling improvements
- ✅ Update documentation with new features

### **2. Deploy Frontend to Production (Priority 2)**
```bash
# Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
cd beatwizard-frontend
npx vercel --prod

# Option B: Netlify Drop
# Upload build folder to netlify.com/drop

# Option C: GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

**Why Deploy Frontend Now:**
- Resolve CORS issues between localhost and production
