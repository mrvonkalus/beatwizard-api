## 🔄 **Currently In Progress**

### **Backend Deployment Status**
- **Issue:** Render deployment stuck on "phase_1" 
- **Expected:** "phase_1_m4a_enhanced" with M4A support + NLU system
- **Triggered:** Fresh rebuild ~2 hours ago
- **Status:** Awaiting Render rebuild completion

### **What's Deploying:**

- Complete FFmpeg dependencies

## 🎵 **Current Capabilities (Working Now)**

### **Backend (Live at https://beatwizard-api.onrender.com)**
- ✅ Health checks and API structure
- ✅ Full audio analysis (WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG)
- ✅ Basic M4A analysis (limited codec support)
- ✅ RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- ⏳ Enhanced M4A support (pending rebuild)
- ⏳ Advanced NLU conversation system (pending rebuild)

### **Frontend (Running at http://localhost:3000)**
- ✅ Complete wizard chat interface
- ✅ File upload with drag & drop
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Professional animations and polish
- ✅ Dynamic conversation suggestions
- ✅ Production build ready

## 🚨 **Known Issues**

### **Active Issues:**
1. **M4A File Support** - Partially working, full support pending deployment
2. **CORS Issues** - Between localhost:3000 and production API
3. **File Size Limits** - 61MB file caused 502 error (25MB recommended)
4. **Render Rebuild** - Taking longer than expected (~2+ hours)

### **Workarounds:**
- Use WAV, FLAC, MP3 files for guaranteed compatibility
- Keep file sizes under 25MB for best performance
- Deploy frontend to production to avoid CORS issues
