       - Highlight problem frequencies in red
       - Show EQ suggestions visually
       - Generate before/after comparisons
   ```

2. **📈 Progress Tracking**
   ```python
   # New module: progress_tracker.py
   def track_improvement(self, current_analysis, previous_analyses):
       - Compare mixing skills over time
       - Show skill progression charts
       - Celebrate improvements achieved
       - Set next goals automatically
   ```

3. **📱 Quick Mobile Demo**
