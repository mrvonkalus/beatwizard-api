# ðŸš¨ Railway Deployment Debug Checklist

## Step 1: Railway Dashboard Investigation

### Check These in Order:
- [ ] **Deployments Tab**: Are there any red/failed deployments?
- [ ] **Build Logs**: Any `pip install` errors?
- [ ] **Deploy Logs**: Does gunicorn start successfully?
- [ ] **Settings â†’ Source**: Is correct repository connected?
- [ ] **Settings â†’ Environment**: Are variables set correctly?

## Step 2: Common Railway Error Patterns

### Build Fails:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies requirement
```
**Fix**: Update requirements.txt versions

### Deploy Fails:
```
gunicorn: command not found
```
**Fix**: Add gunicorn to requirements.txt

### Port Binding Fails:
```
[CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT
```
**Fix**: Check Procfile has correct app name

## Step 3: Nuclear Option - Fresh Railway Project

If all else fails:
1. Delete current Railway project
2. Create new project from GitHub
3. Select `mrvonkalus/beatwizard-api` repository
4. Let Railway auto-configure

## Step 4: Alternative Deployment (Backup Plan)

If Railway continues to fail, try:
- **Render.com** (free tier)
- **Heroku** (paid but reliable)
- **Vercel** (for simple APIs)

## Success Indicators:
- âœ… Build Status: "Success"
- âœ… Deploy Status: "Success" 
- âœ… Health check: `curl https://your-url/health` returns JSON
- âœ… API responds: `curl https://your-url/api/info`
